    <h1>Getting Started Guide</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Jira 2 Post-it is an online tool that retrieves tickets from Jira and
        formats them for printing, making it easy to add tickets to the teamâ€™s
        physical board in 5 short steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sign in</li>
        <li>Choose the tickets</li>
        <li>Stick the sticky notes on a template sheet</li>
        <li>Print</li>
        <li>Stick the sticky notes on the board</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Sign in</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Jira 2 Post-it works with your usual Jira credentials.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter your Jira username and password.</li>
        <li>
          The board id is easily retrievable on Jira. For that, go to Jira,
          navigate to the board and the id is in the url under the name
          "rapidView".
        </li>
      </ol>
      <img

        alt="where to find the board id in the url"
      />
      <div *ngIf="!authenticated()" class="centered-container">
        <button routerLink="/login" class="regular-button">Sign in</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Printing configuration</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Once signed in, you have the opportunity to configure what type of tasks
        are printed on big post-its and which ones are printed on small tickets.
        Big tickets are 127 x 76 mm post-its. Small ones are just big ones cut
        in thirds after printing.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../../assets/big-small-tickets.png"
        alt="big and small tickets"
      />
      <p>
        To configure, you'll need to enter your project key, so that Jira 2 Post-it
        can retrieve the type of tasks configured on your project. Just like the
        boardId, it's easily retrievable on Jira. It is the key that prefixes
        all your ticket numbers.
      </p>

      />
    </div>
    <h2>Choose the tickets</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Two use cases have been identified according to wether your board is a scrum board
        or not.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Scrum board</h3>
          <p>
            Most likely, you'll want to print tickets at the end of the sprint planning meeting to get your board ready for the following sprint.
            You will be presented with the list of active and future sprints of your board. Choose the relevant one to you.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Kanban board</h3>
          <p>
            With those type of boards, there's no predefined moment for printing. This is why you will be presented with a list of all the tickets of the board,
            and given the opportunity to select those to print.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Prepare for printing</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        In both cases, after selecting the tickets to print, Jira 2 Post-it will generate a page representing the printable tickets. Firstly, you need to print the positioning template. You will find it in the <a routerLink="/templates">Templates</a> page.
        It needs to be printed on an A3 page with a 100% scale. Given the size of your project, print as many positioning template pages as required.
        To make them more durable, put some tape where the sticky part of the sticky note will be. Over time sticking and unsticking post-its damages the template sheets and the tape strenghtens them.
      </p>

    <h2>Print</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>Grab your templates sheets, you'll need as many as the number of pages you are going to print.</li>
        <li>Stick post-its in the black frames.</li>
        <li>Go to the printer, position your template sheets in the rack 2 of the printer. Make sure your post-its are facing towards the top and the sticky part is on the left side.</li>

        />
        <li>Print as you usually would</li>
        <li>Stick the post-its on your board. You will need to cut in thirds some tickets if you have chosen to have some issue types printed on small tickets.</li>
